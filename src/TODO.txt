Hi Ondrey ??

I have added a new module for the Nuvoton controller. 
I have made it aware of port addresses, rather than devide nodes (that changes when devices are reconnected)

It is tempthing to make other changes, but I don't have the meens to test it all.
So I have tried to minimise changes, to the other parts.
The main change is that I use the serial number string, as a more generic unique identification string.

I might have other improvements later, 
Please accept this pulle request, and let me know, if anything needs fixing.
